**DESCRIPTION OF TASKS PERFORMED**  

1. **Page Structure Creation**:
Enter Page: Created an initial landing page (div.enter-page) that occupies the full viewport. It contains a welcome message and a button to enter the site. The background image is a gradient design related to science and education.
Main Content: After the user clicks the "Enter" button, the main content of the platform becomes visible. This content includes three key sections: Courses, Quiz, and Progress tracking.
2.** Navigation Setup**:
A navigation menu was added with three links (Courses, Quiz, and Progress) that guide the user to their respective sections within the platform. The navigation links are styled as buttons.
3. **Courses Section**:
Created a section to display available courses.
Added two example courses:
English: A course introducing basic English with a video embedded from W3Schools.
Maths: A course for problem-solving, with a YouTube video embedded using an iframe.
Styled each course with headings, descriptions, and videos.
4.** Quiz Section**:
Implemented a basic quiz with two multiple-choice questions.
Each question has three answer buttons, and when clicked, the checkAnswer() function updates the score depending on whether the answer is correct or incorrect.
The score is dynamically displayed and updated as the user answers the questions.
5.** Progress Tracking Section**:
A progress bar is created to track the user’s learning progress.
The progress bar is inside a container and visually fills up when the user clicks the "Complete Task" button, which increases the progress by 10%.
The progress percentage is displayed next to the progress bar.
6.** JavaScript Functions**:
enterSite() Function: Hides the initial "Enter" page and reveals the main content when the user clicks the "Enter" button.
checkAnswer() Function: Checks the user’s answer in the quiz and updates the score.
updateProgress() Function: Updates the progress bar by 10% each time the button is clicked and ensures it does not exceed 100%.
7. **Styling**:
Applied various CSS styles for layout and design:
Page Layout: Centered content and made it responsive with flexible elements.
Buttons: Styled the buttons with padding, background color, and border-radius to make them visually appealing.
Courses Section: Styled the course sections with padding and box-shadow to create a clean, modern look.
Progress Bar: Styled the progress bar with a green color to indicate progress.
8. **HTML Structure**:
Structured the document with proper HTML5 elements such as div, nav, and video, ensuring semantic organization for ease of readability and potential future enhancements.
Used internal CSS for styling and placed the JavaScript functions at the end of the body for better loading performance.
Summary of Tasks:
Created the initial layout and design.
Developed interactive elements like quizzes, courses, and progress tracking.
Implemented JavaScript functions to handle user interactions (quiz answers and progress).
Designed the platform to be responsive and visually appealing.
